### ✅ **Step-by-Step to Install the APK on Your Phone**

#### **Option 1: Using USB (Recommended for Developers)**

1. **Enable Developer Mode & USB Debugging on your phone:**

   * Go to **Settings > About phone**.
   * Tap **Build number** 7 times to enable Developer Mode.
   * Go back to **Settings > Developer options**.
   * Turn on **USB Debugging**.

2. **Connect your phone via USB**.

3. **Use ADB to install**:

   * Open terminal where your `.apk` file is located.
   * Run:

     ```bash
     adb install your-app-name.apk
     ```

4. The app should be installed and appear on your home screen.

#### **Option 2: Using File Transfer (No ADB)**

1. **Send the `.apk` to your phone:**

   * Use **WhatsApp**, **Telegram**, **Gmail**, **Google Drive**, **AirDrop**, or simply copy it via **USB cable**.

2. **Open the `.apk` file on your phone**:

   * Tap it to install.
   * If prompted, **allow installation from unknown sources**:

     * Go to **Settings > Security > Install unknown apps**.
     * Allow from the app (e.g., Chrome, File Manager, etc.).

3. **Install the app**.

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting

* If you get an error like *"App not installed"*, make sure:

  * You **uninstall** any previous version of the app with the same package name.
  * The APK is **signed correctly**.
  * You’re not mixing **debug APK on a production-only device**.

If you used **Expo** to build your app and generated a `.apk`, it should work directly. But if you’re using a custom native build (via Android Studio or `eas build`), signing keys might matter for production.
